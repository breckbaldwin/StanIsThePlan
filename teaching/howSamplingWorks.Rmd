# Metropolis/Hastings

<need to describe>===map to baseball problem? 

I want the prob distribution of a baseball player with 1 hit at 4 at bats. 
Maximum liklihood is 250 hitter. Actual probability is 0 that P(hit) = .2500000. 
To get a probability we need to break it down into a historgram, what a 250 hitter means is .2495 <= P(hit) < .2505. 

A 'pro hitter' is a hitter that hits 250 or better. We really want 'is X a good hitter' given 1 hit in 4 at bats. Maximum liklihood estimate (MLE). The paramater of interest (POI) is 'is X a good hitter', what is the probability they are? 

P(X is a good hitter | 1 hit/4 at bats) = 

  P(X is a good hitter | hit) ? P(X is a good hitter |out) ? P(X is a good hitter |out) ? P(X is a good hitter |out)
  
  P(X is a good hitter | hit) = 

X is a good hitter = X's true batting average ability > 200 

```{r}
samples = array(500) #numeric(500) # 500 samples.
samples[1]=110 # The initial guess

for (i in 2:500)
{
  target = 0.0
  proposal = samples[i-1] + rnorm (1, 0, 5) # Proposal value
  threshold = runif (1)
  if (dnorm (proposal, 100, 15) / dnorm (samples[i-1], 100, 15) > threshold)
    samples[i] = proposal # Accept proposal
  else (samples[i] = samples[i-1]) # Reject proposal
}

hist(samples)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
