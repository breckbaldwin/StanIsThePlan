Sales pitch: A fully fleshed example
  A/B testing example
  Naive example of straight counting. How can this be improved?
    Sentivity to what we know about click through rates generally
    Sensivity to the amount of data we have. With huge data just count.
    We can do well with less data,the methods are:
      priors: Don't waste effort figuring out that 10% is the expected rate. ? how much do you gain from strong priors?
      It reduces your data consumption by order of maginitude. 
    Write program to add the same data to a non-pooled and a partially pooled stan progam. 
    
    clicks per 500 views
    
    A 1 B 0

    +/- prior that is interesting
    +/- partial pooling
    visualize how it looks as you add data
    
    blue vs purple +100k
    
        
    
  One Page w/10% rate, what do you think?
    Is this good, bad, normal. 
    Ask what is a good click through rate? 
      Introduce notion of prior
      W/o prior you may have to do lots more data collection
        size of data matters whether naive assumpotiosn or priors
    We can do better with both priors and similar alternatives that we want the best of.
    
    

Introduction of scope
  - What we will cover. 
  - Getting started with Rstudio Cloud
    - Credentials, github/google/facebook to url https://rstudio.cloud/project/405221
    - Copies my home dir to your own instance. All relevant class materials should be there in Lecture0 folder. Click to the right of the folder icon, file name....
    - "save a permament copy" if you want to come back to where you left off. 
    - Compile/run simple Stan program

Sampling demo
  - single value normal
      - we get probability distribution for possible values for the_answer
  - single value lognormal--doesn't work great, 20 mean for 42 answer
      *exp(mean(dist)) = 20
  - 20x single value lognormal works fine. 

  - add data that supports a distribution
  - Do it by generating from a distribution, this is a step in Bayesian work flow. 
  - Discuss bad fits and the signs of them in diagnostics. 
  - 
#Discrete vs continuous data

#How sampling works
  - met hastings

From "The end of Average"
p 11 "Averages have thier place. If you're comparing two differnent groups of people, liek comparing...., as opposed to comapring two individuals from each of those groups."

"(averages) create the illusion of knowledge, when in fact the average disguises what is most important about an individual."

"

Averages drive us towards beige/grey if the extremes are colors. 
SHow the paint trick of mixing paint stipes and unmixxing them to original.https://theawesomer.com/color-unmixing-machine/525432/

Art idea: take the Mona Lisa, get average of all colors and paint it. 
Get iconic images and turn it into a guessing game what the source was. Get Karen to do the work/PR. 
Make them puzzles as to what exactly has been averaged over. Round image. Title with Stan program. Recreate orignial with more and more complete representation.
