0- Given the below data points,

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

There is a unique solution. 


1- What will the posterior of the following Stan model resemble?
============
parameters { 
  real<lower = 0, upper=100> to_be_estimated;
} 
model { 
}
============

- nothing, won't do anything without constraints in model block
- roughly uniform distribution from 0 to 100
- .....

2- Is the concept of prior hard coded into Stan?

3- Why does more data increase confidence? 

4- What situations call for point estimates rather that posteriors?
  - problems where average values are important and extremes are not. 
  
5- What situations call for posteriors rather than point estimates?
  - multiple dimensions 
  - problems where maximum or minimum values are important.
