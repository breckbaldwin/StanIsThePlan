0- Given the below data points,

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

There is a unique solution. 


1- What will the posterior of the following Stan model resemble?
============
parameters { 
  real<lower = 0, upper=100> to_be_estimated;
} 
model { 
}
============

- nothing, won't do anything without constraints in model block
- roughly uniform distribution from 0 to 100
- .....

2- Is the concept of prior hard coded into Stan?

3- Why does more data increase confidence? 

4- What situations call for point estimates rather that posteriors?
  - problems where average values are important and extremes are not. 
  
5- What situations call for posteriors rather than point estimates?
  - multiple dimensions 
  - problems where maximum or minimum values are important. 

Baseball

What is the difference between discrete and continuous data? 

What is the difference between 1 hit for 4 times at bat and 10 hits at 40 times at bat?

What is a maximum liklihood estimtate? 

What is the mean of the following distribution?

What is the mode of the following distribution? 

What is the difference between multimodal and multinomial.

Describe the relationship between a posterior distribtution and a point estimate for a player that has hit 4/10. What happens when that is 400/1000? 

How Stan Works

What is the equivalent form of the following Stan program?

- If we believe that the data generating process behind a phemonmenon under study is normally distributed, if we have one data point 3, please rank in relative liklyhood order the following subsequent values. Ties are possible

  - 99
  - 3
  - 0
  - -1

Rank the same data assuming that we think the underlying distrubutin is uniform with one data point of 3.

  - 99
  - 3
  - 0
  - -1

If I have two paramater values, 10, 100 with equal probability, what distributions are unlikely to fit this phemenone well?

*uniform(0,200)
*normal(60,sigma)
*exponential(3)

Describe the parmterization that would make these values equi-probable:
5 and 10
*normal(7.5,.1)
*normal(7.5,100)
*uniform(5,100)
*normal(0,10)


True/False: If I get a successful fit from a stan program I can rely on the resuts.

Priors must preceede liklihood in a Stan program

All estimated paramters have to have a prior in a Stan program

- What the the probability of 3.442 in the following graph? (show uniform dis from 1 to 10 at .1 value. 

---|
*0, we can only assign probabilties to intervals.
*.1
*3.442/.1


- What the the probability of the interval 3 to 4 in the following graph? (show uniform dis from 1 to 10 at
*0
* .1
* .3+.4/2 = .35


- What does pooling do?
* shares information between things that could be thought of as seperate, e.g. performance of baseball players, web pages.

- What are good candidates for pooling?
* Coins from a roll of nickles.
* height and weight
* clicks per 500 views in A/B testing a web site.
