All coins maybe unfiar due to surface shape of heads vs tails.

The interesting experiment is how much power do you need to conclude I am right? A null hyp test may take too long. A parameter probab approach may take much less data, e.g. p(coin is fair) vs p(coin is very slightly unfair)

What is the name of relative prob style approach?

I want to conclude with 95% confidence that my coin is 51% tails biased.

Null Hyp is 50% tails biased.
